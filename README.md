# FactBox

FactBox is a website where the user can choose between several categories such as Science, Music and Film and receive 10 random facts about them. This project uses a Bootstrap template, Angular and HTML/CSS for front-end and Node Express for back-end development. Node Express fetches the facts from JSON files generated ChatGPT to display these facts as requested by the user. The website is hosted at https://adit-sinha.github.io/FactBox/!
